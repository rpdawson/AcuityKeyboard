# QuadrantSwipe

Status:
- Keyboard activity fully functional
- Keyboard service now fully functional
- Keyboard service registers gestures and successfully sends input back to OS.

To do:
- App lifecycle - onPause(), onResume(), onDestroy() etc. 
  - particularly when you close the keyboard for one app and it keeps the data for the other app
- Vibrate/flash feedback on swipe
- UI revamp. Buttons look kinda ugh

Possibly:
- Moving cursor around
